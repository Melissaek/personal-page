                    <p>I have the unique opportunity to work at my own university, the University of Guelph, specifically within the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences (CEPS). This vibrant academic environment thrives on innovation and technology, with computer science playing a crucial role in the college's operations. From managing academic websites to providing essential online resources for students, faculty, and staff, the need for web development expertise is constant. Each department and school within the college maintains its own unique site, housed within the broader University of Guelph website. These sites are essential for providing up-to-date information and resources for students, faculty, and staff, requiring constant updates and improvements.

My goal was to communicate more efficiently without overthinking every message, striking a balance between clarity and speed. I tracked my response times and gradually learned to trust my communication abilities, which resulted in a significant boost in confidence and efficiency. I successfully met this goal, as I now feel more comfortable and effective in my online interactions, saving valuable time that can be redirected towards other tasks.

By creating clear action plans and organizing my work, I aimed to reduce feelings of overwhelm and improve my efficiency. Throughout the term, I experimented with different organizational methods, such as using bookmarks, structured folders, and consistent task management systems. While I still occasionally encounter moments of uncertainty, I now have strategies in place to navigate these challenges effectively. This structured approach will benefit my future work experiences by providing a reliable framework for handling complex projects.

                            <p class="goal-description" id="goal3">As a computer science student, my work often leans heavily on technical skills, leaving limited room for creativity. My goal was to explore creative thinking within the constraints of web design platforms, pushing boundaries and experimenting with design possibilities. By brainstorming independently before researching existing designs, I found new ways to express my creativity, often uncovering innovative solutions despite platform limitations. I learned to approach problems from multiple perspectives and not be deterred by constraints. While I’ve made significant progress, I recognize there’s always more room to grow, and I plan to continue refining this balance in future roles.

                    </h2>
                    <p>Entering the tech world as a woman initially filled me with apprehension, but working in a predominantly female environment during my co-op term provided the supportive atmosphere I needed to feel more comfortable and confident in my role. Being part of this positive team helped me focus on my tasks and grow professionally. One of the most rewarding aspects of my experience was the collaboration with another co-op student; our open communication, idea exchange, and mutual support were instrumental to our project's success. We also engaged regularly with other co-op students in different roles, broadening our perspectives and highlighting the importance of teamwork. This experience underscored that while technical skills are crucial, strong interpersonal skills and a respectful, collaborative work culture are equally vital for success in the tech field.</p>
