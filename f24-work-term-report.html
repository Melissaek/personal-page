                    <h3>Reflecting on My Second Term as Website Redesign Coordinator</h3>
                    <p> I was very excited when my position as Website Redesign Coordinator at the University of Guelph was extended into a second term – a chance to continue growing in a role I’ve truly enjoyed. This second term wasn’t just a continuation; it brought new challenges, fresh opportunities, and a deeper sense of accomplishment. While my first term focused on building foundational skills and starting key projects, this term allowed me to take on more advanced tasks, refine my abilities, and see those initial projects through to completion. For an overview of my role and employer, you can check out my <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps" target="_blank">first-term report</a>, but this reflection dives into what made this term stand out.

                    <h2 style="color:#c20531">Projects and Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>In my second term as the Website Redesign Coordinator at the University of Guelph, I independently took full responsibility for preparing and launching websites for the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences and 3 of its departments. Building on the groundwork from my first term, I managed every stage of the website launch process—from technical setup to final deployment.</p>

                    <p>This included:</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Updating links, writing meta descriptions, and refining designs to meet AODA compliance standards.</li>
                        <li>Structuring intuitive navigation menus for students, staff, and faculty.</li>
                        <li>Collaborating closely with the IT team during the launch process to address technical challenges and implement necessary fixes.</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the appropriate individuals were trained to manage and maintain their sites after launch.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <p>Working with the IT team provided me with the opportunity to learn about the backend of academic website launches, including coding requirements, system limitations, and troubleshooting challenges. I acted as the main point of contact for all website-related issues, coordinating communication, resolving challenges, and ensuring everything stayed on schedule.</p>

                        <div class="text-column">
                    <p>Through these efforts, I successfully delivered accessible, functional, and user-friendly websites, which are now actively serving the university community. You can explore the launched sites here:</p>
                
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps" target="_blank">College of Engineering and Physical Sciences</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/chemistry" target="_blank">Department of Chemistry</a></li>

                    </ul>
                
                    <p>The process of launching these websites was long and involved, with many steps and stages along the way. But seeing the sites finally go live and being used by students, staff, and faculty was incredibly fulfilling.</p>

                    <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
                    <p>During my second co-op term, my communication skills improved significantly. I became more confident and efficient in responding to messages and emails, which helped reduce anxiety in my work. My oral communication also grew stronger, allowing me to explain complex ideas clearly and in a way that’s easy to understand. I now feel more comfortable contributing to meetings, expressing my thoughts, and making meaningful impacts in conversations. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, I had the opportunity to volunteer as an upper-year Computer Science student during the Fall Open House, where I spoke in front of prospective students. I shared my experiences, offered advice, and answered questions, further developing my public speaking skills and ability to communicate in front of larger audiences. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Organization and Time Management</h3>
                    <p>With increased responsibilities, I developed a more efficient system for staying organized. I used folders, sticky notes, and to-do lists to track tasks and manage projects effectively. Despite a more complex workload, I’ve felt much less overwhelmed compared to last term. This term, my approach to tackling tasks became more streamlined, allowing me to focus on delivering results rather than sorting through details. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Creativity and Problem-Solving</h3>
                    <p>This term, I expanded my understanding of creativity beyond just web design. Although my focus shifted to preparing websites for launch, I realized that creativity plays a crucial role in technical tasks as well. Innovative thinking was key in overcoming challenges, improving workflows, and finding efficient solutions. This shift in perspective allowed me to tackle more complex problems with a fresh and creative approach. </p>

                <h2 style="color:#c20531">Reflection</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on my second co-op term, I am proud of the progress I've made both professionally and personally. Taking full responsibility for launching multiple department websites allowed me to grow in areas like communication, organization, and creative problem-solving. While the work was more technical, I learned that creativity plays a key role in every stage of a project, not just the design. I gained confidence in expressing my ideas and took on new responsibilities, such as volunteering at the Fall Open House to speak to prospective students. Along the way, I also formed meaningful connections with my colleagues and supervisors, learning from their expertise and gaining valuable insights. This term has given me the skills and confidence to tackle more complex challenges in the future, and I’m excited to continue applying these lessons in my career. </p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Alex Besszong for her unwavering support and mentorship throughout my co-op term. From the very beginning, Alex trusted me with significant responsibilities, guiding me through each phase of the project with patience and encouragement. Her mentorship allowed me to grow both professionally and personally, and I am incredibly thankful for the opportunity to work so closely with her. Her trust in me has been a key factor in my success, and I couldn’t have navigated this term without her constant support. 
                    </p><p>I am also deeply grateful to Bogdan for his trust in my abilities and for challenging me to think critically and push myself further. His approach to giving me responsibility and allowing me to navigate challenges independently helped me grow more confident and resourceful in my work. </p>
                    <p>Thank you both for making this co-op experience so rewarding and for helping me develop skills and confidence that will serve me well moving forward. </p>
